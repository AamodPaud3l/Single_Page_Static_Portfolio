              My why: I enjoy working with messy, real-world data and turning it
              into insights people can actually use.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m particularly interested in analytics work that supports
              reporting, operational decisions, and stakeholder-facing insights,
              especially where data quality is unclear or reporting needs
              improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              From validating and analysing data to building dashboards and
              explaining results, my focus is on making data easier to
              understand so better decisions can be made with confidence.
